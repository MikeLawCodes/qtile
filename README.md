Qtile Configs. WIP


Starting to Learn Python, So I figured I would live in Python and also learn git. 
RoadMap: Fully theme the WM and Stock Bar,
         Create custom plugins for 
                                   Volume and Device switching, 
                                   Calendar, 
                                   Power Menu, 
                                   Removeable media(Flash Drives),
                                   Clickable Rofi button,
                                   Right Click menu(similar to awesomewm),
                                   Script & Button for theme changing
